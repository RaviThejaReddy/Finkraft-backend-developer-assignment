# **Back-End Developer Assignment**

Objective: To evaluate the candidate’s understanding of RESTful API development, basic database operations with SQL and NoSQL databases, and containerization with Docker.

1. **Project Overview:**
    - Develop a RESTful service for a product catalog with basic user authentication.
2. **Core Requirements:**
    - Create API endpoints to register a user, list products, add a new product, and get product details.
    - Use a SQL database (any of the candidate’s choice) for user data.
    - Use a NoSQL database (any of the candidate’s choice) for product data.
    - Containerize the application and databases using Docker.
3. **Database-Related Tasks:**
    - Design a simple schema for the SQL user table and NoSQL product documents.
    - Provide basic SQL script for user table creation and NoSQL setup instructions.
4. **Deployment Workflow:**
    - Include a **`Dockerfile`** for setting up the environment and running the application.
    - Use **`docker-compose`** to orchestrate the multicontainer setup, including the API service, SQL database, and NoSQL database.
5. **Deliverables:**
    - Source code in a Git repository with a comprehensive README on setup and usage.
    - A minimal **`docker-compose.yml`** that runs the application and databases.
6. **Evaluation Criteria:**
    - Basic endpoint functionality and data validation.
    - Proper integration with SQL and NoSQL databases.
    - Use of Docker for development and deployment purposes.
